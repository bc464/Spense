# Welcome to Codewell! ðŸ‘‹

Codewell's aim is to provide you with real-world design templates that you can use to practice your HTML and CSS projects.

Free or paid, all templates are high quality and will make great portfolio pieces.

### I've completed the challenge, now what?

We recommend using one of these two websites to deploy your projects

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

They're super easy to setup and you should have your website up and running in no time, just follow their instructions.
